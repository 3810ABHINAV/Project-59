  <p>The series takes place at the Gokuldham Co-operative Housing Society – an apartment complex in Powder Gali, Goregaon East, Film City road, Mumbai – and centres around the members of Gokuldham Society. The residents of Gokuldham are shown facing mundane problems and finding solutions for those problems. The show also occasionally highlights social issues. Most of the episodes are based on Jethalal being stuck in a problem and Taarak Mehta, his best friend, whom he calls his "Fire Brigade", rescues him. They help each other in their problems, to promote unity in diversity. Gokuldham is lively and often laughs. The members of Gokuldham celebrate all the festivals like a family and organise various events. The responsibility of organising these events is often on Tapu Sena's shoulders while Bhide is tensed about exceeding the budget.

  <p>He has a younger sister named Thea Stilton,[5] a cousin named Trap Stilton,[5] and a favourite nephew, nine-year-old Benjamin Stilton (Ben) and also Petunina Pretty Paws. Geronimo is a nervous, mild-mannered mouse who would like nothing better than to live a quiet life, but he keeps getting involved in faraway adventures with Thea, Trap, and Benjamin, and sometimes Aunt Sweetfur. The books are written as though they are autobiographical adventure stories.

      Papercutz obtained the rights to publish English translations of the graphic novels of Geronimo Stilton. These retain some of the original names of the characters that were changed in the storybooks translated by Scholastic. For example, the English translations of the graphic novels by Papercutz continue to use the names "Patty Spring" and "Pandora", while the storybooks by Scholastic changed these names to Petunia Pretty Paws and Bugsy Wugsy, respectively.</p>
